# Overview

SRTMT (Simulated Real Time Multu Threading) is a way to have uncooperative multithreading without the use of inturrupts or multiple real threads/processes.


programs are compiled to a mips3 32 bit little endian program and ran through an emulator. 


## Other Info

you can use substidude `mipsel-linux-gnu-ld` for `mips-linux-gnu-ld` by adding `-EL` to the linker flags
